# Data-Structure-File
this folder contains all the experiments of data structure using c++
lab experiment 1(lab1.cpp)
Write a menu driven program that implements following operations on a  linear array:
•	Insert a new element at a specified position
•	Delete an element either whose value is given or whose position is given
•	To find the location of a given element
•	To display the elements of the linear array

lab experiment 2(lab2.cpp)
Write a program to accept N numbers from the user and store them in an array. Then, accept another number from the user and search that using Linear Search.

lab experiment 3(lab3.cpp)
Write a program to accept N integers from the user and store them in an array. Sort the array in ascending order using Bubble sort. Then accept another number from the user, search whether that number exists in the array using Binary Search. If it does, display its index and if it doesn’t, then print that the number is not found in the array.
